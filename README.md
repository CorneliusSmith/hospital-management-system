# hospital-management-system
hospital management system using databases, mysqli and php. 

To run it you must first dowload the hospital.sql file and use that to populate a database on phpmyadmin and the code for connecting to the database must be changed. For my own testing I ran a local AAMPS server. When presented with the login page login with the username Tom and password t1234 or create your own admin table in phpmyadmin.
